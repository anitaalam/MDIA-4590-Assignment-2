                        Before I became a front-end web developer, I was an English teacher in South Korea. During my time there, I picked up a lot of hobbies, one of them being bullet journaling. While I journaled a lot, I realized how much I enjoy recreating layouts or having an idea and puting that on to journal. Now I thought if I can do this digitally how much fun that would be. That is when I explored my options so I can continue to do what I love and learn more of what I can do, and applied to the New Media Design and Web Development program at BCIT.<br><br>I’d like to think I have an old soul. I like to drink hot tea, even in the summer. I spend a lot of time practicing calligraphy and I enjoy expensive lattes at coffee shops. I like reading fantasy books because it allows me to imagine things that’s far beyond what this world can comprehend. Sometimes, I’d join my friends on 5+ hour hikes because I want to go on an adventure.
